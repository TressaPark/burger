# 13 Node Express Handlebars – Burger

### Description

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* When a user submits a burger's name, the app will display that burger on the left side of the page - waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a **Devour it!** button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not. 

### Motivation

**Homework 13 Node Express Handlebars – Burger** was created for Northwestern University Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp

### Contributors

Tressa Park, student at Northwestern University's Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp
Frederica Blissett, tutor
Inspired by Week 13 Activity: 17-CatsApp.

### Tech Used

This was built using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.

### Important

The node_modules folder is not included in my github repository. This is because the folder can be very large (several hundreds of Mb), and would cause pushes to take a very long time, and potentially not up-to-date with the server.

If you would like to run this project locally, users will have to run *npm i*.

### Build Status

This is currently being worked on for submission.

### Hosting on Heroku

Now that we have a backend to our applications, we use Heroku for hosting. Please note that while **Heroku is free**, it will request credit card information if you have more than 5 applications at a time or are adding a database.

Please see [Heroku’s Account Verification Information](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/account-verification) for more details.

### One More Thing

This is a really tough homework assignment, but we want you to put in your best effort to finish it.

If you have any questions about this project or the material we have covered, please post them in the community channels in slack so that your fellow developers can help you! If you're still having trouble, you can come to office hours for assistance from your instructor and TAs.

### Reminder

When trying to connect remotely to your Heroku database on an open network such as a coffee shop, library, or even your University WiFi, it will be blocked. If you are experiencing a Heroku connection error, this could be why.

**Good Luck!**
