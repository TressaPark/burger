### Description

An app that tracks burgers that the user wants to devour (or not.)

### Motivation

**Homework 13 Node Express Handlebars – Burger** was created for Northwestern University Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp

### Contributors

* Tressa Park, student at Northwestern University's Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp
* Frederica Blissett, tutor

### Tech Used

This was built using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.

### Important

The node_modules folder is not included in my github repository. This is because the folder can be very large (several hundreds of Mb), and would cause pushes to take a very long time, and be potentially not up-to-date with the server.

If you would like to run this project locally, users will have to run *npm i*.

### Build Status

This is currently being worked on for submission. Please visit (https://morning-spire-80921.herokuapp.com/) to view my application.
